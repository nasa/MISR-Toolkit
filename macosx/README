This directory is for the Mtk Mac OS X Installer. The Packages directory contains the needed files to create OS X metapackage installers (.mpkg) using the Packages app ( http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html )

IMPORTANT: You MUST "make clean" in the Mtk source directory right before using the build command in Packages or the created mpkg will be broken.

NOTE: By default the scripts install_manager, download_libraries, and install_hdf+hdfeos in the macosx/Packages directory used by this system have a "PREFIX=/tmp".
      When distributing for general use, these prefixes should be changed to be blank ( "PREFIX=" )
 

--- New Procedure for release ---
Packages should now create a flat package (.pkg), which can be distributed and installed directly.

However, it order to get past gatekeeper checks, it will need to be signed with a Developer ID Installer certificate:
productsign --sign "Developer ID Installer: Jet Propulsion Laboratory (XXXXXXXX)" macosx/Packages/build/Mtk_Packages.pkg macosx/Packages/build/Mtk_Packages_signed.pkg

In addition, to run on Catalina and greater, the software should also be notarized, and the notarization ticket stapled to the package.
To submit the package for notarization:
xcrun altool --notarize-app --primary-bundle-id "gov.nasa.jpl.mtk" --username "<email_address>" --password "@env:PASSWORD" --file macosx/Packages/build/Mtk_Packages_signed.pkg -itc_provider JetPropulsionLaboratory

On submitting the package for notarization, you will get back a notarization_id that you can use to check the status.

To check the status of notarization:
xcrun altool --notarization-info <notarization_id> -u "<email_address>" --password "@env:PASSWORD" -itc_provider JetPropulsionLaboratory

Once, notarization status is successful, to staple the notarization to the package:
xcrun stapler staple macosx/Packages/build/Mtk_Packages_signed.pkg

--- Old Procedure is below ---
To bundle for release, you should put the Packages created mpkg into a sparse R/W DMG file and then convert that DMG to a R/O Compressed DMG.
Example release steps follow:

1) Create Sparse RW DMG file.
hdiutil create -size 100M -type SPARSE -volname "MtkInstaller" -fs HFS+ MtkInstaller.dmg.sparseimage

2) Attach to image. Note disk and mounted volume name from output (ex. /dev/disk2s1 and /Volumes/MtkInstaller)
hdiutil attach MtkInstaller.dmg.sparseimage

3) Copy in mpkg installer
cp -R Packages/build/Mtk_Packages.mpkg /Volumes/MtkInstaller/

4) Detech from image.
hdiutil detach -force {mounted disk} (ex. hdiutil detach -force /dev/disk2s1)

5) Create compressed read only image from writable sparse image.
hdiutil convert "MtkInstaller.dmg.sparseimage" -format UDZO -o "MtkInstaller.dmg" -ov -imagekey zlib-level=9
